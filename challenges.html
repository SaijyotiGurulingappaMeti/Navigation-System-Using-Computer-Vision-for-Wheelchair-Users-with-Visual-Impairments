    <p>

      Navigating safely is a major concern for blind wheelchair users. 
      In this section, we explore the technical, environmental, and user-related challenges faced by such systems, 
      followed by possible directions for future improvements to enhance safety, reliability, and user experience.

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stereo vision depth maps are noisy, especially for small curbs at a distance.</li>
        <li>Algorithms for terrain detection and path planning require high computation power.</li>
        <li>Affordable hardware has limited processing capacity for real-time vision.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Environmental Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong sunlight, shadows, or nighttime reduce camera accuracy.</li>
        <li>Reflections from wet pavement or glass can cause misclassification.</li>
        <li>Moving obstacles like cars, bicycles, and pedestrians are harder to detect and predict.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>User-Related Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many alerts (audio or tactile) can overwhelm the user.</li>
        <li>Feedback must be minimal, clear, and actionable (e.g., “turn left” instead of continuous beeps).</li>
        <li>Systems must balance autonomy with user control so that users feel safe and independent.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <ul>


        <li>Increase robustness so the wheelchair can handle all lighting conditions, including bright sunlight, shadows, and nighttime. This may be achieved by combining regular cameras with infrared or depth cameras.</li>
        <li>Improve dynamic obstacle handling—future systems should detect static curbs and objects and also track and predict the movement of pedestrians, bicycles, or vehicles in real time.</li>
        <li>Use advances in embedded AI hardware to run complex vision algorithms on low-cost processors, making the system faster and more practical for everyday use.</li>
        <li>Enhance user interaction by providing multimodal feedback (speech, tones, vibrations) that adapts to the user’s preference, ensuring guidance is clear but not overwhelming.</li>
        <li>Research adaptive autonomy, allowing the system to balance giving full control to the user and automatically intervening to prevent accidents, enabling blind users to feel both safe and independent.</li>
      </ul>
